# Expense-App

The Expense App is a simple web application designed to help users track their expenses. Users can input the amount spent and a brief description of what the expense was for, and the app will update the total amount spent and display a list of expenses.

Features:

> Add Expense: Users can input the amount spent and a description of the expense, then click the "Add" button to add it to the list.

> Delete Expense: Users can delete an expense from the list by clicking the delete button next to the expense item.

> Total Calculation: The app dynamically calculates the total amount spent and updates it whenever an expense is added or deleted.

Technologies Used:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

Note: The Backend will be added shortly.
